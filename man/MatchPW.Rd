Preferential Within-cluster Matching 
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
This function implements preferential within-cluster matching. In other words, units that do not match within clusters (as defined by the \code{Group} variable) can match between cluster in the second step. 
}
\usage{
MatchPW(Y = NULL, Tr, X, Group = NULL, estimand = "ATT", M = 1,
 exact = NULL, caliper = 0.25, replace = TRUE, ties = TRUE, weights = NULL, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{Y}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{Y} here~~
A vector containing the outcome of interest. 
}
  \item{Tr}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{Tr} here~~
A vector indicating the treated and control units. 
}
  \item{X}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{X} here~~
A matrix of covariates we wish to match on. This matrix should contain all confounders or the propensity score or a combination of both.
}
  \item{Group}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{Group} here~~
A vector describing the clustering structure (typically the cluster ID). This can be any numeric vector of the same length of \code{Tr} and \code{X}  containing integer numbers in ascending order otherwise an error message will be returned. Default is NULL, however if \code{Group} is missing, NULL or contains only one value the output of the \emph{Match} function is returned with a warning.  
}
  \item{estimand}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{estimand} here~~
The causal estimand desired, one of "ATE", "ATT" and "ATC", which stand for Average Treatment Effect, Average Treatment effect on the Treated and on the Controls, respectively. Default is "ATT". 
}
  \item{M}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{M} here~~
The number of matches which are sought for each unit. Default is 1 ("one-to-one matching").
}
  \item{exact}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{exact} here~~
An indicator for whether exact matching on the variables contained in \code{X} is desired. Default is FALSE. This option has precedence over the caliper option.
}
  \item{caliper}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{caliper} here~~
A maximum allowed distance for matching units. Units for which no match was found within caliper distance are discarded. Default is 0.25. The caliper is interpreted in standard deviation units of the \emph{unclustered} data for each variable. For example, if caliper=0.25 all matches at distance bigger than 0.25 times the standard deviation for any of the variables in \code{X} are discarded. The caliper is used for both within and between clusters matching.
}
  \item{replace}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{replace} here~~
Default is TRUE. Note that setting the parameter to FALSE would give a warning since only the within-matching part can be performed without replacement (see Details).
}
  \item{ties}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{ties} here~~
An indicator for dealing with multiple matches. If more than M matches are found for each unit the additional matches are a) wholly retained with equal weights if ties=TRUE; b) a random one is chosen if ties=FALSE. Default is TRUE.
}
  \item{weights}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{weights} here~~
A vector of observation specific weights.
}
  \item{\dots}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
Please note that all additional arguments of the \code{Match} function are not used.
}
}
\details{
%%  ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
The function performs preferential within-cluster matching in the clusters defined by the variable \code{Group}. In the first phase matching within clusters is performed (see \code{MatchW}) and in the second the unmatched treated (or controls if estimand="ATC") are matched with all controls (treated) units. This can be helpful to avoid dropping many units in small clusters.

  \item{index.control}{The index of control observations in the matched dataset.}

     \item{est}{The causal estimate. This is provided only if \code{Y} is not null. If estimand is "ATT" it is the (weighted) mean of \code{Y} in matched treated minus the (weighted) mean of \code{Y} in matched controls. Equivalently it is the weighted average of the within-cluster ATTs, with weights given by cluster sizes in the matched dataset.} 
      \item{se}{A model-based standard error for the causal estimand. This is a cluster robust estimator of the standard error for the linear model: \code{y ~ constant+Tr}, run on the matched dataset (see \code{\link{cluster.vcov}} for details on how this estimator is obtained).}
\item{mdata}{A list containing the matched datasets produced by \code{MatchPW}. Three datasets are included in this list: \code{Y}, \code{Tr} and \code{X}. The matched dataset for \code{Group} can be recovered by \code{rbind(Group[index.treated],Group[index.control])}.

# Kreft and De Leeuw, Introducing Multilevel Modeling, Sage (1988).   
# The data set is the subsample of NELS-88 data consisting of 10 handpicked schools 
# from the 1003 schools in the full data set.
 
# Let us consider the following variables:

X<-schools$ses #X<-as.matrix(schools[,c("ses","white","public")])
Y<-schools$math
Tr<-ifelse(schools$homework>1,1,0)
Group<-schools$schid
# Note that when Group is missing, NULL or there is only one Group the function
# returns the output of the Match function with a warning.

# Suppose that the effect of homeworks (Tr) on math score (Y)
# is unconfounded conditional on X and other unobserved schools features.
# Several strategies to handle unobserved group characteristics
# are described in Arpino and Cannas, 2016 (see References). 


# Multivariate Matching on covariates in X 
# default parameters: one-to-one matching on X
# with replacement with a caliper of 0.25; see also \code{Match}).
 

 
### Match preferentially within school 
# first match within schools
# then (try to) match remaining units between schools
 mpw <- MatchPW(Y=schools$math, Tr=Tr, X=schools$ses, Group=schools$schid, caliper=0.1)
 # equivalent to
 # CMatch(type="pwithin",Y=schools$math, Tr=Tr, X=schools$ses, 
 #   Group=schools$schid, caliper=0.1)

# examine covariate balance
  bmpw<- CMatchBalance(Tr~ses,data=schools,match.out=mpw)

# proportion of matched observations
  (mpw$orig.treated.nobs-mpw$ndrops) / mpw$orig.treated.nobs 
# check drops by school
  mpw$orig.ndrops.by.group  
# proportion of matched observations after match-within only
  (mpw$orig.treated.nobs-sum(mpw$orig.ndrops.by.group.after.within)) / mpw$orig.treated.nobs

# complete output
   mpw
# or use summary method for main results
   summary(mpw) 


#### Propensity score matching

# estimate the propensity score (ps) model

mod <- glm(Tr~ses+parented+public+sex+race+urban,
family=binomial(link="logit"),data=schools)
eps <- fitted(mod)

# eg 1: preferential within-school propensity score matching
psmw <- MatchPW(Y=schools$math, Tr=Tr, X=eps, Group=schools$schid, caliper=0.1)

# We can use other strategies for controlling unobserved cluster covariates
# by using different specifications of ps (see Arpino and Mealli for details):

# eg 2: standard propensity score matching using ps estimated
# from a logit model with dummies for schools

mod <- glm(Tr ~ ses + parented + public + sex + race + urban 
+schid - 1,family=binomial(link="logit"),data=schools)
eps <- fitted(mod)



dpsm <- MatchPW(Y=schools$math, Tr=Tr, X=eps, caliper=0.1)
# this is equivalent to run Match with X=eps

# eg3: standard propensity score matching using ps estimated from 
# multilevel logit model (random intercept at the school level)


require(lme4)
mod<-glmer(Tr ~ ses + parented + public + sex + race + urban + (1|schid),
family=binomial(link="logit"), data=schools)
eps <- fitted(mod)


mpsm<-MatchPW(Y=schools$math, Tr=Tr, X=eps, Group=NULL, caliper=0.1)
# this is equivalent to run Match with X=eps
