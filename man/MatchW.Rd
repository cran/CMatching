This function implements multivariate and propensity score matching within clusters defined by the \code{Group} variable.

\arguments{
  \item{Y}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{Y} here~~
A vector containing the outcome of interest. 
}
  \item{Tr}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{Tr} here~~
A vector indicating the treated and control units. 
}
  \item{X}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{X} here~~
A matrix of covariates we wish to match on. This matrix should contain all confounders or the propensity score or a combination of both.
}
  \item{Group}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{Group} here~~
A vector describing the clustering structure (typically the cluster ID). This can be any numeric vector of the same length of \code{Tr} and \code{X}  containing integer numbers in ascending order otherwise an error message will be returned. Default is NULL, however if \code{Group} is missing, NULL or it contains only one value the output of the \code{Match} function is returned with a warning.   
}
  \item{estimand}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{estimand} here~~
The causal estimand desired, one of "ATE", "ATT" and "ATC", which stand for Average Treatment Effect, Average Treatment effect on the Treated and on the Controls, respectively. Default is "ATT". 
}
  \item{M}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{M} here~~
The number of matches which are sought for each unit. Default is 1 ("one-to-one matching").
}
  \item{exact}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{exact} here~~
An indicator for whether exact matching on the variables contained in \code{X} is desired. Default is FALSE. This option has precedence over the caliper option.
}
  \item{caliper}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{caliper} here~~
A maximum allowed distance for matching units. Units for which no match was found within caliper distance are discarded. Default is 0.25. The caliper is interpreted in standard deviation units of the \emph{unclustered} data for each variable. For example, if caliper=0.25 all matches at distance bigger than 0.25 times the standard deviation for any of the variables in \code{X} are discarded. 
}
  \item{weights}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{weights} here~~
A vector of specific observation weights.
}
  \item{replace}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{replace} here~~
Matching can be with or without replacement depending on whether matches can be re-used or not. Default is TRUE.
}
  \item{ties}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{ties} here~~
An indicator for dealing with multiple matches. If more than M matches are found for each unit the additional matches are a) wholly retained with equal weights if ties=TRUE; b) a random one is chosen if ties=FALSE. Default is TRUE.
}
  \item{\dots}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{\dots} here~~
Note that additional arguments of the Match function are not used.

This function is meant to be a natural extension of the \code{Match} function to clustered data. It retains the main arguments of \code{Match} but it has additional output showing matching results cluster by cluster. %The function output is an object of class ("\code{CMatch}"), which can be analyzed with the \code{MatchBalance} function and summarized using S3 \emph{summary} method.
 It differs from wrapper \code{Matchby} in package \code{Matching} in the way standard errors are calculated and because the caliper is in standard deviation units of the covariates on the overall dataset (so the caliper is the same for all clusters). Moreover, observation weights are available.  %An alternative estimator is the weighted average of cluster specific standard errors, which is provided by the \code{Matchby} function.

If estimand is "ATT" it is the (weighted) mean of \code{Y} in matched treated units minus the (weighted) mean of \code{Y} in matched controls.

This is a cluster robust estimator of the standard error for the linear model: \code{Y ~ constant+Tr}, run on the matched dataset (see \code{\link{cluster.vcov}} for details on how this estimator is obtained). Note that these standard errors differ from a weighted average of cluster specific standard errors provided by the \code{Matchby} function, which are generally larger.

# Kreft and De Leeuw, Introducing Multilevel Modeling, Sage (1988).   
# The data set is the subsample of NELS-88 data consisting of 10 handpicked schools 
# from the 1003 schools in the full data set.
 
# Let us consider the following variables:

X<-schools$ses #X<-as.matrix(schools[,c("ses","white","public")])
Y<-schools$math
Tr<-ifelse(schools$homework>1,1,0)
Group<-schools$schid

# Note that when Group is missing, NULL or there is only one group the function returns
# the output of the Match function with a warning.

# Suppose that the effect of homeworks (Tr) on math score (Y)
# is unconfounded conditional on X and other unobserved schools features.
# Several strategies to handle unobserved group characteristics
# are described in Arpino and Cannas, 2016 (see References). 


# Multivariate Matching on covariates in X 
# default parameters: one-to-one matching on X
# with replacement with a caliper of 0.25; see also \code{Match}.

### Matching within schools
 mw<-MatchW(Y=Y, Tr=Tr, X=X, Group=Group, caliper=0.1)
 # equivalent to CMatch(type="within",Y=Y, Tr=Tr, X=X, Group=Group, caliper=0.1)
 
 # compare balance before and after matching

#### Propensity score matching

# estimate the propensity score (ps) model

mod <- glm(Tr~ses+parented+public+sex+race+urban,
family=binomial(link="logit"),data=schools)
eps <- fitted(mod)

# eg 1: within-school propensity score matching
psmw <- MatchW(Y=schools$math, Tr=Tr, X=eps, Group=schools$schid, caliper=0.1)

# We can use other strategies for controlling unobserved cluster covariates
# by using different specifications of ps:

# eg 2: standard propensity score matching using ps estimated
# from a logit model with dummies for schools

mod <- glm(Tr ~ ses + parented + public + sex + race + urban 
+schid - 1,family=binomial(link="logit"),data=schools)
eps <- fitted(mod)



dpsm <- MatchW(Y=schools$math, Tr=Tr, X=eps, caliper=0.1)
# this is equivalent to run Match with X=eps

# eg3: standard propensity score matching using ps estimated from 
# multilevel logit model (random intercept at the school level)

require(lme4)
mod<-glmer(Tr ~ ses + parented + public + sex + race + urban + (1|schid),
family=binomial(link="logit"), data=schools)
eps <- fitted(mod)

mpsm<-MatchW(Y=schools$math, Tr=Tr, X=eps, Group=NULL, caliper=0.1)
# this is equivalent to run Match with X=eps
